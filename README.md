# Image-to-Caption-Generator-
Generating a caption for a given image is a challenging problem in the deep learning domain. We used different computer vision and NLP techniques to recognize the context of an image and describe them in English. We will build a working model of the image caption generator using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory).
